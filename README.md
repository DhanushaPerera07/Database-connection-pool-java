## ABOUT THIS PROJECT

Connection pool is a cache of database connections maintained so that the connections can be reused when future requests to the database are required. Because of the connections can be reused; this connection pool will save resources, and increase performance. This project created by myself to get an idea about how connection pool implements and working internally. My goal is to build a simple database connection pool. I have used Apache Commons DBCP for my other projects.
